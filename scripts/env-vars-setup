#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Usage: source ./scripts/env-vars-setup
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# * use "source" in front of the script path, so that variables are exported in your shell
# * the variables are set only in the current shell, run this script every time, or automate
#   the setup using your `~/.bash_profile`.

#  Prepare the environment variables used by the application.

# Some settings are used to connect to an external dependency, e.g. Azure IoT Hub and IoT Hub Manager API
# Depending on which settings and which dependencies are needed, edit the list of variables
